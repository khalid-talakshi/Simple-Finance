#SimpleFinance
###Last Readme update: 13/01/2018

##About the App
SimpleFinance is an app which allows users to track their finances without worrying about a bank account. These are for all those cash purchases, as well as less frequent purchases. The app is aimed at teaching kids financial literacy so they begin to develop an understanding of money. Rather than giving your kids a bank account with a card and app, you can simply use this app to help them track their own finances.

##About the Repo
This repo is divided into 2 branches: Django and Mean. Both are meant to build the same app, but they use different frameworks as the app is currently in early development and I would like to see which framework is better.

Hopefully this app can get off the ground soon, but until then please enjoy and ask questions if you want more info.
